Different programs and scripts I wrote for Mathematica 


This is a respository of diferent mathematica scripts I've found, modified or written myself for different projects and things I've needed to do. 

All files are in the Wolfram Script format mostly because I'm lazy...they are not intended to be an actual script to be run as is, 
but rather code, with data (if the script requires data) as an example...They are bare minimum with no comments and only one example that may or may not 
encompass everything they are capable of doing.
